# Database-connectivity--Bookfare-Netbeans-and-MySQL
What is a database?
A database is typically designed so that it is easy to store and access information. A good database is crucial to any company or organisation. This is because the database stores all the pertinent details about the company such as employee records, transactional records, salary details etc

what is a JDBDC?
JDBC is a technology that enables the data program to manipulate data, stored in data base. It allows the java program access database management system using Java code


ABOUT THE PROJECT:
This is a database connectivity project. The IDE environment used for this project is Netbeans. 
This project is used to calculate the price of book and all the information is stored on the database.
Using Java code I created a form to collect the details like book name , number of copies required and the total amount 
to be paid by the customer.
Each and every time the customer enter the details in the form, the details are been stored in the database.
In this project I have created a bookfare table database in MySQL platform which stores the data given by the customers.
The Netbeans IDE is the front end user and the MySQL platform is been used as the back end database.
In this project you can calculate the price of book and also search previous record from the database.
